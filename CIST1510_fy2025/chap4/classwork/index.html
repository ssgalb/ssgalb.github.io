        <p>My interest are in economics and healthcare, with a concentration in financail economics and healthcare finance. I use business news outlets like Bloomberg News and Economist.com to learn about world economic events. 
           My background is also in municipal finance with concentrations in Medicaid finance and public health finance. My published research deals with shared services in small to medium size governments. 
        </p>

        <p>One area in which my research was focused on is the Federal Medical Assistance Program FMAP or Medicaid Matching and how to effectively utilize Medicaid dollars at the State and local level.</p>
