            <h1>America Project</h1>
            <p>How would a Customs Union of the Americasn - CUTA work? The Undersecretary of the Treasury for Internaitonal Finance <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/about/offices/international-affairs"></a> would 
               have oversight over transaction that settle within the customs union. Having borderless trade 
    
            </p>
            <p>
           <p>1. No barries to trade increases productivity and improves the quality of life for all consituents of the customs union. 
            </p>
           <p>2. A system of trade credits for lower income nations that participate in the customs union. The International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Rights or U.S. dollars could be used
           to finance trade credits. Participating nations would contribute an amount based on Gross Domestic Product - GDP and lower income countries would receive trade credits that would be exchanged for Special Drawing Rights or U.S. dolalrs. A stipulation for the 
           trade credit program would be that a portion of the trade credits would be required to be used to purchase imports from countries that participate in the customs union.</p>
            
           <p>3. Imagine a SNAP or food stamp for trade that would used to purchase imports from participating customs union member countries. The clearing of customs union credit could be the responsibility of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Federal Reserve's   
           particpation the Customs Union of the Americas would be a fee for service system and be a revenue driver for the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury.</p>

            <li>By the U.S. exporting financial services to the Customs Union of the America, this would benefit all CUTA members; because the U.S. would have 
            the ability to purhcase more imports from CUTA members.
