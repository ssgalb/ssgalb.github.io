            <p>The Quebec-New York trade corridor is a vital economic link between the Canadian province of Quebec and the U.S. state of New York.
            This corridor facilitates the movement of goods, services, and people across the border, promoting trade and economic growth in both regions.
            Key components of the Quebec-New York trade corridor include: Lumber and Wood Products, Automotive Parts and Vehicles, Agricultural Products, Electronics and Technology, Tourism and Travel.

              <h1>Regional Trade Corridors</h1>

              <p>The following are regional trade zones within the Custom Area that would have fiscal 
              support and fiscal mechanisms that support competitive trade flows and competition amongst 
              the different trade corridors within the Custom Area.</p>
              
              <dl>
                 
                  <dt>Corridors</dt>

                  <dd>The corridors would exist within current sovereign borders. For example, building
                  on the example of the Quebec-New York Corridor; similar corridors could be established 
                  between the Canadian Province of Saskatchewan and North Dakota. 
                  </dd>

                  <dt>The Saskatchewan-North Dakota Corridor</dt>

                  <dd>The Saskatchewan-North Dakota Corridor would be a competitive corridor and provide competition 
                  for the Quebec-New York Corridor. Ideally, the Quebec-New York Corridor may specialize in financial services;
                  while the Saskatchewan-North Dakota Corridor specialize in oil and natural gas exports. There is no guarantee
                  that one corridor will dominate one segment of the custom area. Take for example <a href="https://www.hydroquebec.com">hydroquebec</a>
                  a Quebec based engery producer may very well dominate oil and natural gas exports out of Canada.

              <p>The concept of the trade corridors are inline with President Trump's vision of creating new <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-proposes-freedom-cities-flying-cars-new-campaign-video-2023-3?utm_medium=syndication&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo&utm_source=yahoocom">freedom cities</a>
              on federal lands. These new freedom cities could create 20 new metropolitan areas and expand the U.S. economy by 10 to 15 percent.
              This would add approximately $3 to $7 trillion USD or more to the existing $30.6 trillion USD economy.
